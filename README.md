# Indra's Net Story Builder
Understanding the human mind and its complexities is a challenging endeavor. 
Digital visualizations have been utilized to make sense of complex data in various fields, but their application to the study of human cognition and emotions remains relatively unexplored. 
The online visual story builder is a sub-project of a larger undertaking, namely [Indra's Net Visualizer](https://github.com/abhirakshit/Indras-Net), which aims to create immersive 3D visualizations of mental models using game development platforms.
